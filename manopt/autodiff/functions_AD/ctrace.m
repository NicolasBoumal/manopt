% function traceA = ctrace(A)
%
% Returns the sum of diagonal elements of A. The input A does not have
% to be a square matrix. The function supports both numeric arrays and
% structs with fields real and imag. This file was created because trace
% is not currently supported by dlarrays which we use for automatic
% differentiation: ctrace is a backup function.

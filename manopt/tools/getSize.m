    props = properties(variable); 
    if size(props, 1) < 1
        bytes = whos(varname(variable));
        bytes = bytes.bytes;
    else % code of Dmitry
      bytes = 0;
      for ii = 1:length(props)
          currentProperty = getfield(variable, char(props(ii)));
          s = whos(varname(currentProperty));
          bytes = bytes + s.bytes;

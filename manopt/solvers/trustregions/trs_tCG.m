%
% function [eta, Heta, print_str, stats] = trs_tCG(problem, subprobleminput, options, storedb, key)
%
% Inputs:
%   problem: Manopt optimization problem structure
%   subprobleminput: struct storing information for this subproblemsolver
%       x: point on the manifold problem.M
%       grad: gradient of the cost function of the problem at x
%       eta: starting point problem.M.zerovec(x) or small random tangent
%       vector if options.useRand == true.
%       Delta = trust-region radius
%   options: structure containing options for the subproblem solver
%   storedb, key: caching data for problem at x
%
% Options specific to this subproblem solver:
%   kappa (0.1)
%       kappa convergence tolerance.
%       kappa > 0 is the linear convergence target rate: trs_tCG will
%       terminate early if the residual was reduced by a factor of kappa.
%   theta (1.0)
%       theta convergence tolerance.
%       1+theta (theta between 0 and 1) is the superlinear convergence
%       target rate. trs_tCG will terminate early if the residual was 
%       reduced by a power of 1+theta.
%   mininner (1)
%       Minimum number of inner iterations for trs_tCG.
%   maxinner (problem.M.dim() : the manifold's dimension)
%       Maximum number of inner iterations for trs_tCG.
%       
% Outputs:
%   eta: approximate solution to the trust-region subproblem at x
%   Heta: Hess f(x)[eta] -- this is necessary in the outer loop, and it
%       is often naturally available to the subproblem solver at the
%       end of execution, so that it may be cheaper to return it here.
%   print_str: subproblem specific string to be printed by trustregions.m
%   stats: structure with values to be stored in trustregions.m
%       numinner: number of inner loops before returning
%       hessvecevals: number of Hessian calls during execution
%       limitedbyTR: true if a boundary solution is returned
%
% trs_tCG can also be called in the following way (for printing
% purposes):
%
% function [~, ~, print_header, stats] = trs_tCG([], [], options)
%
% In this case when nargin == 3, the returned stats struct contains the 
% relevant fields along with their corresponding initial values. 
% print_header is the header to be printed before the first pass of 
% trustregions.m. The other outputs will be 
% empty. This stats struct is used in the first call to savestats in 
% trustregions.m to initialize the info struct properly.

% Change log:
%
%   NB Feb. 12, 2013:
%       We do not project r back to the tangent space anymore: it was not
%       necessary, and as of Manopt 1.0.1, the proj operator does not
%       coincide with this notion anymore.
%
%   NB April 3, 2013:
%       tCG now also returns Heta, the Hessian at x along eta. Additional
%       esthetic modifications.
%
%   NB Dec. 2, 2013:
%       If options.useRand is activated, we now make sure the preconditio-
%       ner is not used, as was originally intended in GenRTR. In time, we
%       may want to investigate whether useRand can be modified to work well
%       with preconditioning too.
%
%   NB Jan. 9, 2014:
%       Now checking explicitly for model decrease at each iteration. The
%       first iteration is a Cauchy point, which necessarily realizes a
%       decrease of the model cost. If a model increase is witnessed
%       (which is theoretically impossible if a linear operator is used for
%       the Hessian approximation), then we return the previous eta. This
%       ensures we always achieve at least the Cauchy decrease, which
%       should be sufficient for convergence.
%
%   NB Feb. 17, 2015:
%       The previous update was in effect verifying that the current eta
%       performed at least as well as the first eta (the Cauchy step) with
%       respect to the model cost. While this is an acceptable strategy,
%       the documentation (and the original intent) was to ensure a
%       monotonic decrease of the model cost at each new eta. This is now
%       the case, with the added line: "model_value = new_model_value;".
%
%   NB April 3, 2015:
%       Works with the new StoreDB class system.
%
%   NB April 17, 2018:
%       Two changes:
%        (a) Instead of updating delta and Hdelta, we now update -delta and
%            -Hdelta, named mdelta and Hmdelta. This allows to spare one
%            call to lincomb(x, -1, z).
%        (b) We re-project mdelta to the tangent space at every iteration,
%            to avoid drifting away from it. The choice to project mdelta
%            specifically is motivated by the fact that this is the vector
%            passed to getHessian, hence this is where accurate tangency
%            may be most important. (All other operations are linear
%            combinations of tangent vectors, which should be fairly safe.)
%
%   VL June 29, 2022:
%       Renamed tCG to trs_tCG to keep consistent naming with new
%       subproblem solvers. Also modified inputs and outputs for 
%       compatability with other subproblemsolvers.

% All terms involving the trust-region radius use an inner product
% w.r.t. the preconditioner; this is because the iterates grow in
% length w.r.t. the preconditioner, guaranteeing that we do not
% re-enter the trust-region.
%
% The following recurrences for Prec-based norms and inner
% products come from [CGT2000], pg. 205, first edition.
% Below, P is the preconditioner.
%
% <eta_k,P*delta_k> = 
%          beta_k-1 * ( <eta_k-1,P*delta_k-1> + alpha_k-1 |delta_k-1|^2_P )
% |delta_k|^2_P = <r_k,z_k> + beta_k-1^2 |delta_k-1|^2_P
%
% Therefore, we need to keep track of:
% 1)   |delta_k|^2_P
% 2)   <eta_k,P*delta_k> = <eta_k,delta_k>_P
% 3)   |eta_k  |^2_P
%
% Initial values are given by
%    |delta_0|_P = <r,z>
%    |eta_0|_P   = 0
%    <eta_0,delta_0>_P = 0
% because we take eta_0 = 0 (if useRand = false).

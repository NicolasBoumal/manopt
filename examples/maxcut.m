function [x, cutvalue, cutvalue_upperbound, Y] = maxcut(L, r)
% Algorithm to (try to) compute a maximum cut of a graph, via SDP approach.
%
% function x = maxcut(L)
% function [x, cutvalue, cutvalue_upperbound, Y] = maxcut(L, r)
%
%   This is an example file meant to illustrate functionalities of Manopt.
%   It is not meant to be an efficient implementation of a Max-Cut solver.
%
%   Please see the following repository for more efficient Manopt code:
%   https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/maxcut
%
%
% L is the Laplacian matrix describing the graph to cut. The Laplacian of a
% graph is L = D - A, where D is the diagonal degree matrix (D(i, i) is the
% sum of the weights of the edges adjacent to node i) and A is the
% symmetric adjacency matrix of the graph (A(i, j) = A(j, i) is the weight
% of the edge joining nodes i and j). If L is sparse, this will be
% exploited.
%
% If the graph has n nodes, then L is nxn and the output x is a vector of
% length n such that x(i) is +1 or -1. This partitions the nodes of the
% graph in two classes, in an attempt to maximize the sum of the weights of
% the edges that go from one class to the other (MAX CUT problem).
%
% cutvalue is the sum of the weights of the edges 'cut' by the partition x.
%
% If the algorithm reached the global optimum of the underlying SDP
% problem, then it produces an upperbound on the maximum cut value. This
% value is returned in cutvalue_upperbound if it is found. Otherwise, that
% output is set to NaN.
%
% If r is specified (by default, r = n), the algorithm stops at rank r.
% This may prevent the algorithm from reaching a globally optimal solution
% for the underlying SDP problem, but can greatly help in keeping the
% execution time under control. If a global optimum of the SDP is reached
% before rank r, the algorithm stops then of course.
%
% Y is a matrix of size nxp, with p <= r, such that X = Y*Y' is the best
% solution found for the underlying SDP problem. If cutvalue_upperbound is
% not NaN, then Y*Y' is optimal for the SDP and cutvalue_upperbound is its
% cut value.
%
% By Goemans and Williamson 1995, it is known that if the optimal value of
% the SDP is reached, then the returned cut, in expectation, is at most at
% a fraction 0.878 of the optimal cut. (This is not exactly valid because
% we do not use random projection here; sign(Y*randn(size(Y, 2), 1)) gives
% a cut that respects this statement -- it's usually worse though).
%
% The algorithm is essentially that of:
%
% Journee, Bach, Absil and Sepulchre, SIAM 2010
% Low-rank optimization on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices.
%
% but on the simpler oblique geometry (product of spheres), to avoid theory
% breakdown at rank deficient Y.
%
% It is itself based on the famous SDP relaxation of MAX CUT:
% Goemans and Williamson, 1995
% Improved approximation algorithms for maximum cut and satisfiability
% problems using semidefinite programming
%
% and the related work of Burer and Monteiro 2003, 2005.

% Change log:
%
%   April 3, 2015 (NB):
%       L products now counted with the new shared memory system. This is
%       more reliable and more flexible than using a global variable.
%   Aug  20, 2021 (XJ):
%       Added AD to compute the egrad and the ehess
%   March 25, 2024 (NB):
%       Using obliquefactory rather than elliptopefactory by default as
%       this takes better care of rank deficient matrices.
%   June 26, 2024 (NB):
%       Revamped the example to be more in line with how Manopt evolved.

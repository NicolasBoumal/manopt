Quick installation guide
------------------------

1.  Either git-clone or unzip the whole `manopt` directory you just
    downloaded in a location of your choice, say, in `/my/directory/`.

2.  Go to `/my/directory/manopt/` at the Matlab prompt and
    execute `importmanopt`.

3.  You will be asked whether you want to save this path for your next
    Matlab sessions. If you reply `Y` (yes) and you have the rights to
    run `savepath`, then you won't need to go through these steps next
    time you open Matlab.

4.  Run checkinstall.m.
    If there are no errors, you are all set.
    Otherwise, feel free to let us know on the forum.
